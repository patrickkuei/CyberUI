# Cyberpunk UI Library - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

The **Cyberpunk UI Library** is a React-based UI component library with a cyberpunk aesthetic—featuring neon colors, glitch effects, metallic textures, and dynamic animations. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Storybook for component development and showcasing. The library is modular, reusable, responsive, and designed for both local development and open-source distribution.

### Goals

- Develop reusable UI components with a consistent cyberpunk visual style.
- Use Storybook to showcase and document components from the start.
- Ensure compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.
- Deliver a production-ready library, published as an open-source project on npm and GitHub.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, JSX
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, custom animations
- **Fonts:** Orbitron, Roboto Mono (via Google Fonts or local files)
- **Build Tools:** Vite (local development), Rollup (packaging)
- **Version Control:** Git (local and remote)
- **Showcase:** Storybook (component development, testing, documentation)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup, Git Initialization, Storybook, and Core Components (Week 1-2)

**Objective:**  
Set up the local development environment, initialize Git, configure Storybook, and develop core UI components with cyberpunk styling and Storybook stories.

#### Project Setup

- Initialize Vite project with React:  
    `npm create vite@latest cyberpunk-ui --template react`
- Install dependencies:  
    `npm install react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @storybook/react`
- Configure Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk theme (neon colors: `#00e6e6`, `#ff007a`; shadows; animations).
- Set up local font loading (Orbitron or Roboto Mono).
- Create project structure:

    ```
    cyberpunk-ui/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   │   ├── CyberButton.jsx
    │   │   ├── CyberInput.jsx
    │   │   └── CyberCard.jsx
    │   ├── styles/
    │   │   └── tailwind.css
    │   └── index.js
    ├── stories/
    │   ├── CyberButton.stories.jsx
    │   ├── CyberInput.stories.jsx
    │   └── CyberCard.stories.jsx
    ├── public/
    │   └── fonts/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    ├── tailwind.config.js
    ├── vite.config.js
    └── .storybook/
    ```

#### Git Initialization

- Initialize Git repository:  
    `git init`
- Create `.gitignore`:

    ```
    node_modules/
    dist/
    .DS_Store
    *.log
    .storybook/cache/
    ```

- Add initial commit:  
    `git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up project structure, Vite, and Storybook"`
- Set up remote repository (e.g., GitHub):
    - Create a new repository on GitHub.
    - Link local repo:  
        `git remote add origin <repository-url>`
    - Push initial commit:  
        `git push -u origin main`
- Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT License).

#### Storybook Setup

- Initialize Storybook:  
    `npx storybook init`
- Configure Storybook to work with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- Create stories for core components (e.g., `CyberButton.stories.jsx`).
- Run Storybook locally:  
    `npm run storybook`

#### Core Components

- Develop `CyberButton` with neon glow, scanline animation, and hover effects.
- Develop `CyberInput` with transparent backgrounds and glitch text effects.
- Develop `CyberCard` with metallic textures and subtle animations.
- Write Storybook stories for each component to showcase different states (default, disabled, hover).

#### Styling

- Define global styles for dark backgrounds, neon colors, and glow effects.
- Create reusable CSS classes for glitch and scanline animations, integrated with Tailwind.

**Deliverables:**

- Local Vite project with functional core components.
- Git repository initialized with `.gitignore` and LICENSE, pushed to GitHub.
- Storybook setup with stories for `CyberButton`, `CyberInput`, and `CyberCard`.
- Tailwind CSS configuration with cyberpunk theme.
- Sample Storybook page showcasing core components.

---

### Phase 2: Advanced Components and Animations (Week 3-4)

**Objective:**  
Expand the library with advanced components, enhance animations, and update Storybook stories.

#### Additional Components

- Develop `CyberModal` with glassmorphism and fade-in animations.
- Develop `CyberNavbar` with sticky positioning and neon hover effects.
- Develop `CyberProgressBar` with animated fill and glitch overlay.
- Create Storybook stories for each new component.

#### Animations

- Implement glitch effects using CSS keyframes or JS for dynamic text distortion.
- Add scanline animations to all components for visual consistency.
- Create hover-triggered glow effects using box-shadow and filter.

#### Responsiveness

- Ensure all components are responsive using Tailwind's utility classes.
- Test components in Storybook on mobile and desktop viewports.

#### Git Workflow

- Create feature branches for each component:  
    `git checkout -b feature/cyber-modal`
- Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages.
- Merge to main branch via pull requests.

**Deliverables:**

- Functional `CyberModal`, `CyberNavbar`, and `CyberProgressBar` with Storybook stories.
- Consistent animation suite across all components.
- Responsive design validated in Storybook.
- Updated Git repository with feature branches and pull requests.

---

### Phase 3: Documentation and Testing (Week 5-6)

**Objective:**  
Document the library, enhance Storybook, and ensure reliability through testing.

#### Documentation

- Update `README.md` with installation instructions, Storybook usage, and component examples.
- Document each component’s API (props, events, styling options) in Storybook.
- Deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages or Netlify for public showcase.

#### Testing

- Test components for cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) in Storybook.
- Validate accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Ensure animations perform smoothly without performance degradation.

#### Git Workflow

- Commit documentation and Storybook updates.
- Tag release candidate:  
    `git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`

**Deliverables:**

- Comprehensive API documentation in `README.md` and Storybook.
- Storybook deployed as a public demo.
- Test reports for functionality, accessibility, and performance.

---

### Phase 4: Finalization and Open-Source Release (Week 7-8)

**Objective:**  
Polish the library and release it as an open-source package.

#### Polish

- Refine component designs based on feedback.
- Ensure visual consistency across all components.
- Add optional theming support for custom color schemes in Storybook.

#### Release

- Package library using Rollup:  
    `npm install -D rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs`
- Configure Rollup to generate ESM and UMD modules.
- Publish to npm:  
    `npm publish`
- Update GitHub repository with release notes and tags:  
    `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`
- Deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages or Netlify as the project website.

#### Maintenance Plan

- Set up GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
- Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for community contributions.
- Plan for future updates (e.g., new components, advanced animations).

**Deliverables:**

- Published UI library on npm.
- GitHub repository with release tags and documentation.
- Storybook-based project website with demos and documentation.

- All components use React functional components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Storybook is integrated from the start to streamline development and showcase components.
- Git is used for version control, with a clear branching strategy (main, feature branches, pull requests).
- Animations prioritize CSS for performance but may use JS for complex effects like glitch text.
- The library remains lightweight by minimizing dependencies.
- Storybook enhances open-source appeal by providing an interactive demo and documentation platform.
- Community feedback will be incorporated during Phase 4 to ensure usability.
